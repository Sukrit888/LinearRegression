# Project Title
Predicting Boston Housing Prices with Linear Regression

# Project Description
In this project, I implemented a linear regression model using the scikit-learn library to predict housing prices in Boston. The primary goal was to establish a predictive model that could estimate the 'Price' of houses based on various independent variables, such as crime rates, room counts, proximity to employment centers, and more.

## Key features
- # 1. Data Exploration
  - The project begins with a thorough exploration of the Boston housing dataset, including data visualization and statistical analysis to understand the relationships between variables.
- # 2. Data Preprocessing
  -  I conducted data preprocessing tasks, including handling missing values, feature scaling, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets to ensure model accuracy.
- # 3. Linear Regression Model
   -  I implemented a linear regression algorithm from scikit-learn to create a predictive model. This involved training the model on the training dataset and evaluating its performance on the test data.
- # 4. Model Evaluation
   - I used various evaluation metrics, such as mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared, to assess the model's predictive accuracy and determine its effectiveness.
- # 5. Visualizations
   - The project includes visualizations to illustrate the model's predictions compared to actual housing prices, providing a clear understanding of its performance.
